# TestTask

Usages: 
* [Material Design](https://material.io/design/) for creating layout and animation
* [NgRx](https://ngrx.io) for ReactiveState
* Sass for styling
* [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) quickstart and managing app environments

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
